# SEED GJO utilities

## Overview

In 2004, the SEED (http://theseed.org/) was created to provide consistent and accurate genome annotations across thousands of genomes and as a platform for discovering and developing de novo annotations. The SEED is a constantly updated integration of genomic data with a genome database, web front end, API and server scripts.

## About this module

The seed_gjo module provides a collection of bioinformatics utilities written by Gary Olsen at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).
